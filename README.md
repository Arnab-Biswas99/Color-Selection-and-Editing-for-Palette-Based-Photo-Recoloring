In this project, we have run three code to generate the reflectane image, shadding image and original image. Please make sure all images and codes are in the same directory.

In the colour transfer.cpp I have run the image carrom.png and store the reflectance image in output.png. 

Similarly, carrom_shadding.png is run in gamma.cpp to get the output carrom_s.png. We have take gamma factor=5. 
In final.cpp we have run the output.png and carrom_s.png to get the final output 3.png. Also, we have used carrom_pallet.png to generate the pallet value in colour transfer.cpp.

Running: Run the colour transfer.cpp and choose which colour do you want to add in the image among the colours as follows:
Colours:
	1.Red
    	2.majenta
    	3.brown
    	4.light brown
    	5.cream
    	6.yellow
    	7.sea green
    	8.deep green
    	9.grey green
    	10.green
    	11.skyblue
    	12.blue
    	13.blue violet
    	14.violet
    	15.Pink
Next run the gamma.cpp with shading image only
Next run final.cpp with the output got from gamma.cpp and colour transfer.cpp.
